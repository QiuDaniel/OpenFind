![OpenFind](Assets/Header.png)

An app to find text in real life. Now open-source!

- Search your entire photo library in split seconds.
- Find in real-time using the camera
- Create lists of allergies and find unwanted ingredients instantly.
- Organize photos with stars.
- Look for multiple terms at the same time.
- Runs 100% offline. No servers, nothing weird going on.
- Tons of customizable settings.
- Supports VoiceOver.

OpenFind (formerly **Find**) is my first app â€” I've been working on it for the past 3 years to learn Swift. You can view its entire history (1600+ commits!) here. I hope you can find some use out of this, whether it's from looking at the code, or just using it to find stuff.
